plots
=====

``` r
ggplot(study, aes(x = week, y = value, color = subject_id)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(.~ arm) +
  labs(
    title = "Value Change with Time in Control and Experimental Arms",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Value"
    )
```

![](p8105_hw5_st3117_files/figure-markdown_github/Q1_2-1.png)

The subjects in control arms started at the range of (0, 2.5), and ended up at approximately the same range at 8 week, while the subjects in experimental arms started at the range of (-0.5, 3.75), and ended up at the range of (3.5, 7). In other words, there is no apparent change of value with time in control arms, while there is increasing in experimental arm.

load p2 data
============

``` r
p2_dataset = 
  RCurl::getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") %>%
    read_csv()
```

data cleaning
=============

``` r
homicides =
  p2_dataset %>% 
  mutate(reported_year = as.integer(substr(reported_date, 1, 4)),
         reported_month = month.abb[as.integer(substr(reported_date, 5, 6))],
         reported_day = as.integer(substr(reported_date, 7, 8)),
         victim_race = as.factor(victim_race),
         victim_age = as.integer(victim_age),
         victim_sex = as.factor(victim_sex),
         city_state = paste(paste0(city, ","), state)) %>% 
  select(uid, reported_year, reported_month, reported_day, victim_last:victim_sex, city_state, lat:disposition)

Further iteration

  tibble(city_state = count_homicides$city_state) %>% 
  mutate(map(.x = count_homicides$city_state, ~allcity_prop_test(.x))) %>% 
  unnest
```

plot for estimate
-----------------

``` r

  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(city_state, estimate), y = estimate)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
